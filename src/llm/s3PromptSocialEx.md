The problem with ‚ÄúGreat Replacement Theory‚Äù is that it fails to address the foundational issue of low birth rates.

Record low birth rates are leading to population collapse in Europe and even faster population collapse in most of Asia. Immigration is low in Asia, so there is no ‚Äúreplacement‚Äù going on, the countries are simply shrinking away.

If this doesn‚Äôt turn around, then any countries on Earth with low birth rates will become empty of people and fall into ruin, like the remains we see of the many long dead civilizations.

If you teach that ‚Äúweak makes right‚Äù, then the perceived stronger party ‚Äì in this case, Israel ‚Äì is wrong.

Morals should be taught in the absolute, meaning that it is possible for either the strong or weak to be morally good, depending on their actions.

Can‚Äôt decide whether it is funny, ridiculous or sad that the CEOs of Occidental Petroleum and Delta Airlines are on the new AI safety board.  

Less than half of the 22 members have any real AI knowledge.

Also odd that it‚Äôs not even vaguely bipartisan, has zero open source AI CEOs (Zuckerberg) and excludes Elon who has been the highest profile advocate for AI safety over the last 10 years.

The incumbents will be lobbying hard against open source which would be terrible policy that maximizes the odds of a world with 2-3 dominant AIs, which is the riskiest scenario IMO.

We want a multipolar world of AIs that reflect the rich diversity of human cultures rather than a few AIs grounded in the extremist subset of western culture embodied in Gemini and ChatGPT.
